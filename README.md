### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ I'm a second-year student of a Bachelor of Science in Data Science at Superior School of Computer 
Science (ESCOM - IPN). I come from a solid technical background in computer science; my area of focus 
and interest varies from algorithm & data structures to data analysis. I have been participating in different 
competitions and courses of competitive programing and research works, which developed a wide range of 
skills that would meet and fit the expectations for the role. Being involved in the computer science field, I 
have acquired a deep love for everything about algorithms and data science
